      <h1>States</h1>
      <h2>States of Matter</h2>
      <div id="paragraph-full">
          <p>All matter is comprised of many different stages. These stages, known as states, 
            have their own properties that set them apart from one another. Although there is
             a considerable amount of different states matter can be in, there are four main 
             fundamental states of matter. The four major states are solid, liquid, gas, and 
             plasma. Most elements will transition from one state to the next in order, however,
              there are circumstances where elements skip states, jumping to the next one in 
              order. An example of this is dry ice. Dry ice, being a solid, will begin to transition
               immediately into its gas state once exposed to room temperature conditions. </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Solid</h2>
      <div id="paragraph-right">
          <p>The most dense state of matter is known as a solid. The molecules in this state are the 
            most packed together compared to that of the other states of matter. Once an element is 
            in its solid state, it does not change shape to fill the space it occupies, unlike the 
            other forms. For most elements, a solid will shift into liquid once it has reached a 
            certain temperature. Increasing the pressure can slightly increase this melting point. </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Liquid</h2>
      <div id="paragraph-left">
          <p>Liquid is the middle child that is sandwiched in between its state siblings of solid and 
            gas. If the temperature of the liquid drops too much, it will freeze into a solid. If the 
            temperature of the liquid gets too hot, then it will begin to boil, turning itself into a 
            gas. Unlike a solid, the liquid state will flow and move around, matching the shape of the
             container it sits in. The molecules are spread out a bit more than the solid, but still 
             close compare to that of gas. Out of all states of matter, this is the least common form
              due to its narrow range of temperature and pressure that is required to maintain it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Gas</h2>
      <div id="paragraph-right">
          <p>Gas rests comfortably between the liquid and plasma states of matter. Similar to liquid,
             if a gas becomes too cold or too hot, it will transition over to liquid, if too cold, or
              to plasma, if too hot. Gas can also be changed into plasma by putting it through a strong
               electromagnetic field. Gas is significantly less dense than liquid. </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Plasma</h2>
      <div id="paragraph-left">
          <p>Plasma is the most common form of matter in the universe. It is what all stars are made 
            of. Plasma is formed when enough heat is applied to a gas that the electron is stripped 
            away from its atom. This creates a bunch of elections and ions. The most common form of 
            plasma found here on earth is lighting and the Northern Lights. </p>
